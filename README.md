# CSE556: Natural Language Processing

## About CSE556

**[CSE556: *Natural Language Processing*](http://techtree.iiitd.edu.in/viewDescription/filename?=CSE556)** is a 5xx-level course offered to undergrads pursuing the CSAI and CSE disciplines at IIIT-Delhi. The course introduces various tasks in Natural Language Processing while covering basic text-processing techniques. It aims to enable students to:

- understand basic techniques like [N-Gram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram#:~:text=When%20the%20items%20are%20words,may%20also%20be%20called%20shingles.&text=In%20the%20context%20of%20NLP,traditional%20bag%20of%20words%20setting.), [HMMs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_Markov_model), [CFGs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context-free_grammar), [Morphology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(linguistics)#:~:text=In%20this%20way%2C%20morphology%20is,the%20speakers%20of%20those%20languages.), [Tokenization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_segmentation#Word_segmentation), and [Representation Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_learning)
- understanding advanced NLP techniques like [BERT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BERT_(language_model)), [seq2seq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seq2seq#:~:text=Seq2seq%20is%20a%20family%20of,conversational%20models%2C%20and%20text%20summarization.), [Attention Mechanisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_(machine_learning)), [Transformers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_(machine_learning_model)), etc.
- use and implement existing basic and advanced models and analyze their performance on different datasets
